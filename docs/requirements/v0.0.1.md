# Ticket OK

A lean ticketing system for fast-paced teams.

## Purpose

As the CTO of a tech consulting company that heavily uses Trello, we are having a hard time tracking key performance
metrics (namely [lead and cycle times](https://www.agile-academy.com/en/agile-dictionary/lead-time-vs-cycle-time/)). We
are using a homebrew card format that the project manage fills out at the start of the sprint and has to manually track
across the project lifecycle. Every set interval (say, a month) we generate a report from these cards via a custom
script that uses the Trello API. Needless to say, this process is tedious and can break in a lot of ways (since there is
no validation on these fields, for example).

Ticket OK is an attempt to solve this issue

## Features

- Allow creation of tickets ("tasks" or "features") that contains the following:
    - Required:
        - Assigned person
        - Estimated time of completion
        - Ticket creation date (autogenerated)
        - Problem Statement
    - To be filled out later:
        - Problem Notes
        - Assigned QA
        - QA Status (FAIL/PASS)
        - QA Notes
    - Actions
        - Change status (READY/IN PROGRESS/FOR REVIEW/DONE)
        - Add comments
        - Assign multiple users
        - Add a blocker, which changes the status to BLOCKED
- Audit trail
    - Any changes on the card must be tracked
- Lead and Cycle times should be auto computed when the task is completed

Ticket OK will be implemented as a web application using a three-tier architecture. It could start either as an SPA or a
monolithic application, but exposing an API should be always be a consideration for the succeeding versions.
